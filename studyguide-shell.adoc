. Suppose a file system has the following hierarchy
+
[source]
----
root
+ home
++ ren
+++ A    
++ stimpy
+++ B
+++ C
++++ hello.txt      
----
* What is the absolute path of `hello.txt`?
* If we are in the directory A, what is the relative path of hello.txt?
* If we are in the directory B, what is the relative path of hello.txt?

. Draw the directory hierarchy after the following commands
+
[source]
----
$ pwd
/home/alinen
$ mkdir A
$ cd A
$ mkdir Z
$ touch talk.c
$ cd ..
$ touch listen.c
$ cd
$ touch sing.c
----

. Consider the following file properties listed with `ls -l`
