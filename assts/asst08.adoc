= File System

_Based on the project by Dianna Xu_

In this project, you will implement a file system from scratch. A "disk" in this project is a single
Unix file that is "formatted" so that it is understandable to your "OS". You can think of such a file
as a disk image. You must provide a shell that will be able to navigate this file system and execute
commands that allow a user to perform normal file system related activities. See below for details.

Your file system should have a hierarchical tree structure, support file
permissions and mounting.  You should also provide a separate "format" utility
that creates and initializes your disk files. The format program should run
separately from your shell. You may base your implementation on previous work
from any team member.

= Overview

The design of the file system internals is entirely up to you. Either a MS-DOS
compatible FAT system or a Unix-like inode-based system are logical choices. As
before, you should implement reasonable emulations of true FAT or inodes.  In
other words, if you do FAT, then it needs to be at least FAT-12 and if you do
inodes, it needs to be at least as sophisticated as early Unix V7. Whichever
type you choose it must support a hierarchical directory system. When making
decisions, you should go with conventions and make sizes powers of two. For
example, you should stick with the standard block size of 512 bytes (even if you
choose FAT, you can assume that your disk isn’t going to be large enough to
require a bigger block size), and not assume too small a maximum file size. That
is, design your data structures so that it is possible for a single file to take
up many GBs, even if your current disk isn’t even remotely large enough.

Tanenbaum discusses physical implementations of file systems in Chapter 4, and in Sections
10.6 and 11.8, which are good references. As usual, you are encouraged to research widely and use
any resources you find useful, but are cautioned against taking large amounts of code that you do
not understand.

= File System Functions

A file system should have two components: 

* the physical structure and 
* the virtual structure. 

== The Virtual File System

A Virtual File System (VFS) is a robust interface to multiple physical disks of varying types (you
may only have one, of course). The basic idea behind VFS is to provide a generic representation
of the hierarchical file system in memory, as well as a set of functions to access parts of the file
system.

The basic structure of the VFS is the vnode. A vnode can represent a file, a directory or a mount
point. The vnode contains generic information about what it represents (name, permissions, etc).
It also contains specific information depending on the file system (physical inode, FAT pointer),
and a pointer to a set of functions specific to that file system type. In general, you want to use the
vnode to store the structure of the file system (i.e. location in hierarchy, location on disk, etc) and
the physical layer to store individual file data.

[source]
----
typedef struct vnode {
    int vnode_number;
    char name[255];
    struct vnode *parent;
    int permissions;
    int type;
    union {
        struct unix_fs { /* these structs need to be fleshed out by you */
            int inode;
        } unixfs;
        struct dos_fs {
            int fat_ptr;
        } dosfs;
        struct ram_fs {
            unsigned long offset;
        } ramfs;
    } fs_info; /* file system specific info */
} vnode_t;
----

You are not absolutely required to implement the full VFS. As long as you fully implement the
required file system library functions (see subsection below). However, in that case, your file system
is hard-wired into one design only and there is no easy way to accept another differently formatted
and designed one without replacing the entire library.

== File System Library Functions

In the files, `vfs.h` and `vfs.c`, implement an API for interacting with your file system. These 
files will be compiled into a dynamic library, `libvfs.so`.

As part of the VFS you need to create programmer-level library functions to provide access to your
file system operations. A list of library functions that you should implement has been outlined for
you. The listed calls are very similar to the equivalent standard ANSI C library functions. Consult
K&R or Unix man pages for specific semantics that you should emulate. 

Your shell should call the appropriate functions from your library when implementing the list
of related built-in commands.

. `f_open`: open the specified file with the specified access (read, write, read/write, append). If the file does not exist, handle accordingly. (rule of thumb: create file if writing/appending, return error if reading is involved). Returns a file handle if successful.
. `f_read`: read the specified number of bytes from a file handle at the current position. Returns the number of bytes read, or an error.
. `f_write`: write some bytes to a file handle at the current position. Returns the number of bytes written, or an error.
. `f_close`: close a file handle
. `f_seek`: move to a specified position in a file
. `f_rewind`: move to start of a file
. `f_stat`: retrieve information about a file
. `f_remove`: delete a file
. `f_opendir`: recall that directories are handled as special cases of files. open a “directory file” for reading, and return a directory handle.
. `f_readdir`: returns a pointer to a “directory entry” structure representing the directory entry in the directory file specified.
. `f_closedir`: close an open directory file
. `f_mkdir`: make a new directory at the specified location
. `f_rmdir`: delete a specified directory. Be sure to remove entire contents and the contents of all subdirectorys from the filesystem. Do NOT simply remove pointer to directory.
. `f_mount`: mount a specified file system into your directory tree at a specified location.
. `f_umount`: unmount a specified file system

== The Shell

You should extend your shell to work with the new file system. This shell does
not need to support pipes or job control. Thus, you can use your "better shell"
if you wish.  Make sure that your shell supports commands such as echo, ps, etc.

. On start-up, the shell should look (in the same directory) for a file called "DISK" where your file system is located. If it is not found, please print a message asking the user to run the format command to make one. For more details on format, see Section 4.
. Once your shell has found the file system, it should mount it at the root directory and display a log-in prompt.
. Create at least a regular user and a super user, and start the user at the appropriate home directory after logging in.
. Support redirections. You need to support parsing for >, and >>. `>>` appends text to a file. 
. The following file-system related commands must now be implemented as built-in commands in your shell. You are not allowed to use the Unix-provided ones, not that they will work with your file system anyways.
.. `ls` - lists all the files in the current or specified directory. Support flags -a and -l.
.. `chmod` - changes the permissions mode of a file. Support absolute mode and symbolic mode.
.. `mkdir` - creates a directory
.. `rmdir` - removes a directory
.. `cd` - changes the current working directory according to the specified path, or to the home directory if no argument is given. Support . and ..
.. `pwd` - prints the current working directory
.. `cat` - displays the content of one or more files to the output.
.. `rm` - deletes a file
.. `mv` - renames a file or directory
.. `stat` - reports the system information for a file

== Format

The format utility program is a separate program that you should make available.
format <name of file> will format a file with your file system design and data structures.
If the file doesn’t exist, create it. The default size for such a disk image should start at
1MB. Add a "-s #" flag to allow the creation of different-sized disks, where # is a number in
megabytes.

== Testing

To initialize a new filesystem, use your format utility

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ ./format <disk_name>
----

This command will create a disk containing a boot block, superblock, free space management, and
initialized root directory. A disk created by format should be passed to your shell to use as the file 
system. When the shell exits, your filesystem should be saved. 

When the shell loads a filesystem, it should read it into your vnode data structure. The layout of the 
file system specifies how the file is stored on disk. The vode tree is the representation that you can 
use to work with files from your shell.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./shell <disk_name>**
myshell$> ls
. .. A.txt B.txt C.txt usr
myshell$> echo "roses are red" > f1.txt
myshell$> ls
. .. A.txt B.txt C.txt f1.txt usr
$ ./shell
myshell$> ls
. ..
myshell$> mount <disk_name> /mnt
myshell$> ls
. .. mnt
myshell$> cd mnt
myshell$> ls
. .. A.txt B.txt C.txt usr
----

In addition to commands listed above, make sure your shell can execute commands such as

* echo "roses are red" > f1.txt
* echo "violets are blue" >>f1.txt
* echo "honey is sweet" > f2.txt
* cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt
* ls > f4.txt
* ps > f5.txt

Implementation Tips:

Start with your file system design (Due at the end of Lab, April 10th). After 
your decide your design, you should implement `format` and use it to create an 
empty file system. Your empty file system should only contain a root directory.

Implementing your shell and file system in vertical slices, one test-able feature at a time. 
For example, the first thing you can implement is *creating a file*. To start, you would 
implement `fopen` and `fclose`, focusing on the ability to create files. 
You should test these functions in their own test program. Then implement `cat`
in your new shell to write to this file (include >). Note that you should not use `exec` to
call cat. You should use your own `cat` routine that works with your file
system.

Here are other features you can implement similarly:

* Saving your file system to file so it can be loaded again the next time you start your shell (f_mount, f_unmount, mount)
* Listing a file's system status (stat)
* Editing a file (f_read, f_write, f_seek, f_rewind, >>, cat)
* Editing permissions (chmod)
* Listing a directory (ls, f_opendir)
* Creating a new directory (mkdir, f_createdir)
* Removing a file or directory (f_unlink)
* Editing names (mv)
* Testing bad data (for example, files/directories that do not exist. Implement error codes in your VFS API)
* Testing other shell commands (should be forked with exec)
