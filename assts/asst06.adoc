= {title}

**Due Friday, February 28, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Understand binary representations of data types
* Directly manipulate basic types at the bit level
* Work with bitwise operators: |, &, ~, ^

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.


= Tiny Bitmaps

A link:https://sneslab.net/wiki/Graphics_Format[1bpp], or 1-bit-per-pixel, 
sprite stores a grid of black and white pixels using a single bit. 0 denotes 
white and 1 denotes black. 

image::https://sneslab.net/mw/images/c/c6/saa03_1bpp.png[width=400px] 

In the program, `bitmap.c`, implement a program that reads in a single 64-bit 
unsigned integer (e.g. `unsigned long`) and outputs it as an 8x8 1bpp sprite.

$ **./bitmap < bitmap1.txt**

Requirements/Hints:

* Your program should *must* use a bitmask! For example, to generate a 64-bit mask that obtains the left-most bit, do `0x1ul << 63`. The `ul` indicates an `unsigned long` value. `0x1` is the number one in hexadecimal.
* The bitmap files store the values as hexadecimal values. To read them in, do `unsigned long img; scanf(" %lx", &img);`. Use `%lx` for printf also. You are given basecode that reads in the long integer from stdin.

= Steganography

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography[Steganography] is the practice of hiding messages in plain sight. In this question, we will hide text messages using the least significant bits of an image.

To understand how we will hide messages in the least significant bits of an image, let's look at the following write-up by 
Chris Trailie, starting with the two pictures below.

<table style="width:650px;">
    <tr>
        <td><h4>Ordinary image</h4></td>
        <td><h4>Hidden message</h4></td>
    </tr>

    The picture on the right contains 12 paragraphs of text on the Ursinus 150 strategic plan.  Can you see the difference?  No?  Well great, that's the point!  
</p>
<p>
    So how do we do this?  The idea is beautifully simple, and is best understood with an example.  Consider the following 3-pixel image
</p>

<table style="width:250px;">
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #fe7732; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[254, 119, 50]</span></td>
        <td style="background-color: #028dfe; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[2, 141, 254]</span></td>
        <td style="background-color: #5b9f40; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[91, 159, 64]</span></td>
    </tr>
</table>

    We're going to extract a binary signal by looking at the <b>least significant bit</b> (the 1's place in binary) of each color channel in each pixel from left to right from red, to green, to blue, and put them together into one binary string.  In other words, for a particular pixel and a particular color channel, we'll extract a 0 if it's an even number and a 1 if it's an odd number.  Let's look at the first 8 bits in the above image.  We have 
</p>
<table style="width:50px;">
    <tr>
        <td>254</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>119</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>50</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>141</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>254</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>91</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>159</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    All together, this is the binary string <b>01001011</b>, which is the character <b>'K'</b> in <a href = "https://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>.  What if we wanted to change it to some other character though?  Perhaps the character <b>'z'</b>, which is <b>0x7A</b> hex, or <b>01111010</b> in binary.  Then we can just tweak the 1's place of the pixel values as follows, where I've bolded the ones that have changed:
</p>

<table style="width:50px;">
    <tr>
        <td>254</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>119</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>51</b></td><td><b>1</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>3</b></td><td><b>1</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>141</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>254</td><td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>91</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>158</b></td><td><b>0</b></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Here's what these updated values look like 
</p>

<table style="width:250px;">
    <tr>
        <td style="background-color: #fe7733; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[254, 119, 51]</span></td>
        <td style="background-color: #038dfe; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[3, 141, 254]</span></td>
        <td style="background-color: #5b9e40; width:50px; height:50px;"><span style="color:white">[91, 158, 64]</span></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    If you were just looking at it and comparing it to what we started with, you would never notice the difference!  So we have freedom to tweak the least significant bit of every color channel of every pixel at will to encode text, and this is exactly what you will be doing in this assignment!.  In a 500x500 image, for example, this means we can store 250,000 bits.  Since each ASCII character is 8 bits, this is 31,250 characters total, or roughly about 6000 words.

:sectnums:

= Decode

In the file, `decode.c`, write a program that reads in a PPM file (raw, or binary, format) and then outputs any message that might be stored in 
the least significant bits of each color. Your program should read bits from each of the red, green, and blue colors -- top to bottom, left to right. 
You should keep decoding until you reach the empty character `\0`.

For example, consider the example file `tiny_encoded.ppm`. Decoding should give you the bits `001100010011011100110100001000010000101000000000`. 

If we group them up into ASCII char variables, we see this is the character string `174!\n`.

<table style="width:100px;">
<tr>
    <td>00110001</td><td><code>'1'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>00110111</td><td><code>'7'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>00110100</td><td><code>'4'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>00100001</td><td><code>'!'</code></td>

Your program should perform as follows.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./decode tiny_encoded.ppm**
Reading tiny_encoded.ppm with width 4 and height 4
Max number of characters in the image: 6
174!
----

Requirements/Hints:

* You should read the PPM filename as a command line argument
* You should report the usage if no file is given to the program
* You should report an error if the file cannot be read
* Re-use your implementation of `read_ppm` and `write_ppm` from link:asst05.html[Assignment 05].
* Output the size of the image along with the maximum number of characters it can store
* For debugging, try printing out values in hex format, e.g. `printf("%02X", c);`
* This question is a little easier if you use a 1D array because you can cast the `struct ppm_pixel*` array to an `unsigned char*` array.

= Encode

In the file, `encode.c`, write a program that reads in a PPM file (raw, or binary, format) and 
asks the user for a message to embed within it. 

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make encode**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror encode.c read_ppm.c -o encode
$ **./encode feep-raw.ppm**
Reading feep-raw.ppm with width 4 and height 4
Max number of characters in the image: 5
Enter a phrase: **lol**
Writing file feep-raw-encoded.ppm
----

Requirements/Hints:

* You should read the PPM filename as a command line argument
* You should report the usage if no file is given to the program
* You should report an error if the file cannot be read
* You should output a new file based on the input name. For example, if the input is `feep-raw.ppm`, the new file with the encoded message should be `feep-raw-encoded.ppm`.
* Re-use your implementation of `read_ppm` from link:asst05.html[Assignment 05].
* Output the size of the image along with the maximum number of characters it can store
* For debugging, try printing out values in hex format, e.g. `printf("%02X", c);`
