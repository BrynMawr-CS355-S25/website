= {title}

**Due Sunday, Feb 16, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Working with signals
* Understanding process state: sleeping, running, stopped, terminated
* Working with additional system calls: sigprocmask, tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp, setpgid
* C practice/review

NOTE: We will use the same starter code as last week: link:https://classroom.github.com/a/z8JKZurc[here]

= Be your best Shell

In the file, `shell.c`, extend the features of your shell from link:asst03.html[Assignment 02]. 

Requirements:

Your shell should satisfy the requirements of link:asst03.html[Assignment 03].
Additionally, your shell should support the following features, outlined in the sections below.

* Backgrounding with & 
* Process suspension with Control-Z 
* fg %<job_num>
* bg %<job_num>
* jobs
* kill [-9] %<job_num> 

NOTE: Even if your previous shell is incomplete, you can still implement the
features of this assignment. Specifically, we will only be testing single
commands (no pipes or redirection) to test the job control features in this assignment.

== Backgrounding with &

Extend your parser and `struct Cmd` structure to hold a flag that indicates 
whether a job should be run in the foreground or background.

NOTE: A job is a set of processes in the same group, started from the command line, and may contain multiple commands, pipes and redirections

When a process is executing in the background, the shell should not block and
wait but rather continue accepting commands. In our previous shell implementations, 
we used `wait` to pause while our child executed. Now, we must detect when our 
background processes complete. Because we do not want our parent process to pause 
while waiting for children to finish, we will use a _non-blocking_ call to `waitpid` that 
will trigger whenever the child's status changes, 
e.g. `waitpid(pid, &status, WNOHANG | WUNTRACED | WCONTINUED)`  
As discussed in class, we can update the status of our background processes either with 
polling in the foreground process, or within a signal handler.

You will also need to keep track of all running jobs. Use a linked list to keep
track of all jobs.

=== Process groups

All processes have a process group. When a process is created, it receives the 
same process group as its parent by default. When we send a signal, it is sent to 
every process in the process group.   

We will be using signals to control child processes. Thus, it is very important 
that all jobs created by the shell have their own process group. Base the process 
group ID using the first spawned process using the `setpgid()` command. Otherwise, 
all jobs will receive the same signals along with the shell, e.g. commands intended 
to kill a job will be sent to the shell as well. 

When switching a job between the foreground and the background, we need to update which 
job has access to the terminal, using the command `tcsetpgrp()`.

== Control-Z

When the user types Control-Z at the terminal, the foreground process will receive the 
signal SIGSTP. When this happens the shell should

* update the job list
* send SIGSTP to the foreground process
* return with a new prompt

When a process is stopped, it remains in this state until it received a continue (SIGCONT)
or terminate (SIGTERM, SIGKILL) signal.

== fg

The fg (foreground) command should bring a background process into the
foreground. If a job ID is given, the specific job should be brought into the
foreground if the ID corresponds to a background job.  If no job ID is given,
the last process most recently put in the background should be made a foreground
process. 

If the given job is stopped, don't forget to send SIGCONT to continue it. 

== bg

The bg (background) command resumes a job suspended by control-Z to run as a background 
process. If job # is omitted, shell should background the last job suspended, if any.

== jobs

Prints a list of jobs that are currently running or suspended/stopped. This list
should include the job number, the command line that started the respective pro-
gram and the status (Running or Suspended). 

== kill

Send a SIGTERM to the specified job and terminate it. You will notice that this does
not terminate many applications, as they register signal handlers to catch SIGTERM.
Implement also the -9 flag to send SIGKILL, which can not be caught.

== Submit your work to Github

Add and check in your program using git and then push your changes to Github. 
Run the following command inside your `{ASST}` directory.

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {ASST}
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Descriptive message"
$ git push
----

Run `git status` to check the result of the previous git command.
Check the Github website to make sure that your program uploaded correctly. 

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (4 points) Shell
** (0.3 points) style and header comment
** (0.7 points) Backgrounding with &
** (0.7 points) Ctrl-Z, fg, bg, jobs
** (0.3 points) kill 
** (2.0 points) Polish. Correct behavior. No memory errors. 

NOTE: When using `readline()`, valgrind will report that some of your memory is
_still reachable_. This memory is not leaked. It hasn't been cleaned up yet from 
`readline()`'s internal memory. For example, output such as the following is ok
[code]
----
==3504== HEAP SUMMARY:
==3504==     in use at exit: 204,143 bytes in 221 blocks
==3504==   total heap usage: 453 allocs, 232 frees, 244,790 bytes allocated
==3504==
==3504== LEAK SUMMARY:
==3504==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==    still reachable: 204,143 bytes in 221 blocks
==3504==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
---- 

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -12.5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to check in work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make

= Resubmission

Your shell program (A03-A04) is eligible for resubmission at the end of the term.
Students can submit up to two times:

* The first time for up to 3.3 credit
* The second time for up to 2.7 credit

Resubmissions cannot be made for missed work. I reserve the right to judge whether an 
earnest effort has been made on the initial submission, but as a guideline, students 
must have received at least a C (2.0), for example, corresponding to a submission that 
has some features working but with memory errors.
