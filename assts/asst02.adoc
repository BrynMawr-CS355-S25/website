= Microcat

_By Dianna Xu_

In the file, `microcat.c`, implement a C program that concatenates and prints files 
to standard output. If no arguments are given, it takes input from stdin.

$ **./microcat lyrics.txt**
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
$ **cat lyrics.txt | ./microcat**
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
$ **./microcat < lyrics.txt**
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
$ **./microcat**
**hello**
hello
**nice hat**

$ **./microcat B.txt A.txt C.txt D.txt**
World
Hello

All life is precious

Requirements/Hints:

* This is basically the Unix `cat` command with no flags. 
* Use the file descriptors STDOUT_FILENO and STDIN_FILENO to specify stdout and stdin istreams respectively
* Your program should use the system calls, link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html[read], link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html[write], and link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html[open]. 
* Ctrl-d will quit your application when reading from stdin

= Parser

_By Kevin Webb_

In the file, `parser.c`, implement a function that parses command line input. This function should use `readline` to get input from the user and then fill in a `struct cmd` that holds the information needed to execute. Your struct should look as follows. 

[source]
----
struct cmd {
  char **cmd1_argv;
  char **cmd2_argv;
  char *cmd1_fds[3];
  char *cmd2_fds[3];
}
----

Sample output from your program should look as follows:

Plain command: `ls -l`

[source]
----
cmd1_args: ["ls", "-l", NULL]  /* three-element dynamically-allocated array */
cmd2_args: NULL  /* There is no second command here. */

cmd1_fds[0]: NULL  /* With no I/O redirects, all descriptors are NULL */
cmd1_fds[1]: NULL
cmd1_fds[2]: NULL

cmd2_fds[0]: NULL
cmd2_fds[1]: NULL
cmd2_fds[2]: NULL
----

Pipe only command: `ls | sort`

[source]
----
cmd1_args: ["ls", NULL]  /* two-element dynamically-allocated array containing */
cmd2_args: ["sort", NULL]  /* two-element dynamically-allocated array containing */

cmd1_fds[0]: NULL  /* With no I/O redirects, all descriptors are NULL */
cmd1_fds[1]: NULL
cmd1_fds[2]: NULL

cmd2_fds[0]: NULL
cmd2_fds[1]: NULL
cmd2_fds[2]: NULL
----

Redirects only: `ls -l 1> out.txt 2> error.txt`

[source]
----
cmd1_args: ["ls", "-l", NULL]  /* three-element dynamically-allocated array */

cmd2_args: NULL  /* There is no second command here. */

cmd1_fds[0]: NULL
cmd1_fds[1]: "out.txt"
cmd1_fds[2]: "error.txt"

cmd2_fds[0]: NULL  /* There is no second command here. */
cmd2_fds[1]: NULL
cmd2_fds[2]: NULL
----

Combined: `grep -i blah < input.txt | sort 1> output.txt`

[source]
----
cmd1_args: ["grep", "-i", "blah", NULL]  /* four-element dynamically-allocated array */
cmd2_args: ["sort", NULL]  /* two-element dynamically-allocated array containing */

cmd1_fds[0]: "input.txt"
cmd1_fds[1]: NULL
cmd1_fds[2]: NULL

cmd2_fds[0]: NULL
cmd2_fds[1]: "output.txt"
cmd2_fds[2]: NULL
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Use only C commands, such as malloc/free, for this program
* The comments above are to help you understand what memory you should allocate. Don't print the information in the comments. 
* Make sure you have no memory errors!
* You can extend the above struct if you like, but don't change the data types!

NOTE: This question is based on this lab by Kevin Webb from link:https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/cs45/s24/labs/lab1.html[here].

= Simple Shell

In the file, `shell.c`, write a program that implements a simple shell. 

image::RainbowShell.png[width=640px]

Requirements:

* Your program should print a prompt. At minimum, your prompt should show the current working directory and look distinct from the lab machine prompts. In other words, it should be easy to tell what shell if running from the terminal.
* Use the `readline()` function to get user input. This function supports backspace, tab completion, and more. link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html[Documentation for readline can be found here].
* Use the `add_history()` function to save user history. This will allow arrow keys to work. link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html[Documentation for readline can be found here].
* Your program should quit if the users types `exit`.
* When the user gives a command, split it into a command and arguments using link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html[execvp]and then fork a command to execute it. 
* Compiles with `make`. (Do not modify the Makefile)
* No memory errors using `valgrind`
* Adheres to the style guidelines and includes a header comment
* Your terminal should wait for the command to finish. If the command terminates with an error, report the error.

NOTE: `readline` is a package that is installed on goldengate and in our labs. However, you may need to install it on your own machine. On Unix systems, this can be done by running `sudo apt install libreadline-dev`  

NOTE: You can print with colors to the console using ANSI escape sequences (see below). 
For example, `printf(ANSI_COLOR_GREEN "Green Text" ANSI_COLOR_RESET);` will print green text. link:https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/mg/ansicolors/index.html[Here is a good guide!]

[code]
----
// Helpful macros for working with color
#define ANSI_COLOR_RED     "\x1b[31m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_GREEN   "\x1b[32m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_YELLOW  "\x1b[33m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_BLUE    "\x1b[34m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_MAGENTA "\x1b[35m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_CYAN    "\x1b[36m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_RESET   "\x1b[0m"
----

NOTE: Most prompts print helpful information. Above, we use the 
system commands `gethostname`, `getcwd`, and `getpwuid(geteuid())` to get the 
machine name, the current working directory, and current user respectively. 


NOTE: To check for valgrind errors, run valgrind with your executable as an argument

== Submit your work to Github

Add and check in your program using git and then push your changes to Github. 
Run the following command inside your `{ASST}` directory.

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {ASST}
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Descriptive message"
$ git push
----

Run `git status` to check the result of the previous git command.
Check the Github website to make sure that your program uploaded correctly. 

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (1 points) Microcat
* (1.5 points) Parser
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.65) Correct behavior: parses line and fills in struct Cmd
** (0.75) no memory errors
* (1.5 points) Simple shell 
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.25 points) Displays unique prompt with current working directory
** (0.1 points) Uses `readline()` and `add_history()`
** (0.1 points) Quits when the user types `exit`.
** (0.1 points) Forks a process to run the user's command. 
** (0.1 points) Reports the return status of the command when the child process completes.
** (0.75 points) no memory errors. 

NOTE: When using `readline()`, valgrind will report that some of your memory is
_still reachable_. This memory is not leaked. It hasn't been cleaned up yet from 
`readline()`'s internal memory. For example, output such as the following is ok
[code]
----
==3504== HEAP SUMMARY:
==3504==     in use at exit: 204,143 bytes in 221 blocks
==3504==   total heap usage: 453 allocs, 232 frees, 244,790 bytes allocated

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.
