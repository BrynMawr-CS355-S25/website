<p><em>Assignment by Dianna Xu</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this assignment, you will write a library to support multiple threads within
a single Linux process. This is a "user-level thread library" because the kernel
doesn’t know these threads exist - they are just something the library
implements and multiplexes onto a single process. While there are differences
between user-level threads and the kernel-level threads we used in
<a href="../labs/lab04.html">Lab 04</a>, building and scheduling actual kernel-level
processes and threads would not be much different, that is, essentially you are
now building a part of pthread from scratch.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You thread library must follow the specification in <code>userthread.h</code>. You may add to this file,
<strong>but you must not edit the given functions</strong>. The required API for your thread library
are described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>int thread_libinit(int policy)</code>: thread_libinit is called to initialize the thread library. policy is one of the following
enum ints: FIFO, SJF, or PRIORITY (see Scheduling section below).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>return value: Upon success, thread_libinit returns 0. Upon failure, it will return -1.</p>
</li>

<p><code>int thread_libterminate(void)</code> thread_libterminate is called to shut down the thread library and do all necessary clean
ups.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>return value: Upon success, thread_libterminate returns 0. Upon failure, it will return -1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>int thread_create(void (*func)(void *), void *arg, int priority)</code> thread_create is used to create a new thread. The last argument priority specifies the
priority level if priority scheduling is selected. When a newly created thread starts, it will
call the function pointed to by func and pass it the single argument arg. When a thread calls thread_create, the caller does not yield the CPU. The newly created
thread is put on the ready queue but is not executed right away.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>return value: Upon success, thread_create returns a positive integer thread ID that can be used later to call thread_join and thus wait for a given thread to terminate. Upon failure, it will return -1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>int thread_yield(void)</code> thread_yield causes the current/calling thread to yield the CPU to the next runnable thread. The yielding thread should be put at the tail of the ready queue. If the caller is the only runnable thread, it will be selected to run again, in other words, the yield will have no effect.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>return value: Upon success, thread_yield should return 0. You may assume that the call always succeeds, which is on par with the current Linux pthread_yield implementation.</p>

<p><code>int thread_join(int tid)</code> thread_join suspends execution of the calling thread until the target thread terminates.</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="_scheduling_policies">2. Scheduling Policies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of this assignment, you will experiment with three scheduling policies: first-come, first-
served (FIFO), shortest-job first (SJF) and priority (PRIORITY).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_first_come_first_served_fifo">2.1. First-come, first-served (FIFO)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Threads on the ready queue should be scheduled according to the order they arrive, without
preemption. Pass FCFS to thread_init to select this schedule.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_shortest_job_first_sjf">2.2. Shortest-job first (SJF)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Threads on the ready queue should be scheduled according to their estimated run time.
Here, you need to keep track of how long a thread runs before calling thread_yield or
thread_join. Pass SJF to thread_init to select this schedule.
Because we cannot know how long a job will take to run, we will use an approximation to
implement SJF. You should use the average of the last three times the thread ran to compute
its job time. In addition, when a job is created, you should assume it is an “average” job and
set its runtime to the average runtime of all threads so far. If there is no runtime history at
all (i.e first thread ever), use a reasonable default value (for example, half of the quanta - see
below)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_priority_based_priority">2.3. Priority-based (PRIORITY)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pass PRIORITY to thread_init to select this schedule. An integer argument representing
a thread’s priority is passed to thread_create at the time of thread creation. Based on
UNIX convention, the smaller the number is, the higher the priority. In this assignment,
there are only three levels of priorities -1, 0, 1. For FIFO and SJF, you can disregard this
parameter. For priority scheduling, threads scheduled with level -1 should run 1.5 times more
often as jobs scheduled with priority level 0, which run 1.5 times more often as jobs scheduled
with priority level 1. It is your scheduler’s responsibility to ensure this ratio is exact.
For priority scheduling, you will schedule a SIGALRM signal to be delivered to your scheduler
every 100 milliseconds. We refer to this event as a clock tick, and on every clock tick the
scheduler will come in and choose which thread to run next. To set an alarm timer at
millisecond granularity, refer to setitimer(2).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_threads_context_switching">2.4. Threads Context Switching</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use the system calls, <code>getcontext</code>, <code>setcontext</code>, <code>makecontext</code>, <code>swapcontext</code>,
to help implement user-level thread context switching.
Please refer to <a href="../labs/lab04.html">Lab 04</a> for details.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_additional_features">3. Additional Features</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_logging">3.1. Logging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help evaluate the functionalities of your scheduler, your scheduler should write to a log file
whenever a thread switches context.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name it <code>userthread_log.txt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log Events: CREATED, SCHEDULED, STOPPED, and FINISHED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log should be tab deliminated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This required for all three scheduling algorithms (FIFO and SJF may leave the
PRIORITY column empty). Document clearly the name of the log file and its path.
The logger should overwrite logs of the last execution of the scheduler program.
That is, it should not accumulate but only record the current session’s
information. The log will have the following format (tab deliminated):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>[ticks] OPERATION TID PRIORITY
For example, here is a snippet of a logger:
...
[100] SCHEDULED 1 -1
[200] STOPPED 1 -1
[200] SCHEDULED 2 -1
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operations requiring logging are CREATED, SCHEDULED, STOPPED, and FINISHED. You should
log any other information you find helpful as long as you document it clearly. Logging is also a
great tool to help you debug your program. It is recommended to implement this feature as soon
as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>printf is not re-entrant and thus there is a risk using it with signal handlers. It’s not a big
deal when you are just printing a message for debugging, but for the logger, you should use the
system call write and STDOUT_FILENO instead. fprintf is thread-safe and thus if you are
logging to a file (which is what you should be doing), you are safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the <code>clock()</code> function to compute the number of ticks from the start of the program.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_valgrind_compatibility">3.2. Valgrind Compatibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately Valgrind by default does not work very well with ucontext. To make it work,
you will need to include valgrind.h header file (Path:/usr/include/valgrind) and use
VALGRIND_STACK_REGISTER and VALGRIND_STACK_DEREGISTER to explicit tell valgrind which
stack space you are using right now. Please see the example provided by Valgrind at https://
github.com/lu-zero/valgrind/blob/master/memcheck/tests/linux/stack_changes.
c. Please pay special attention to the init_context function and see that valgrind requires a
integer id to label each stack and to keep track which stack space is associated with which context.
Error Handling and Testing</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_test_suite">3.3. Test Suite</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An integral (and graded) part of writing your thread library will be to write a suite of test cases
to validate your thread library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each test case for the thread library will be a short C program that uses functions in the thread
library. Each test case should be run without any arguments and should not use any input files.
Test cases should exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) when run with a correct thread library. Below is an example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>/*
 Filename: 1.c
 Test create/run a single thread
 Expected:: I am func1\nMain exiting\n
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "userthread.h"

void func1(void *arg) {
  printf("I am func1\n");
}

int main() {
  thread_libinit(FIFO);
  int ret = thread_create(func1, NULL, 0);
  ret = thread_join(ret);
  printf("Main exiting\n");
  thread_libterminate();
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Requirements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your test suite may contain up to 20 test cases and should contain at least 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each test case may generate at most 10 KB of output and must take less than 60 seconds to run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each test case, you should have a header that explains what it tests for, AND (this is important) what the expected CORRECT behavior is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, keep the test cases short and narrow. It’s better to test only one thing so that when a program fails a test, you know exactly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your tests into the subdirectory, labeled <code>tests</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name each test with a number, e.g. <code>1.c</code></p>
</li>

<h2 id="_advice">4. Advice</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deleting a thread and exiting the program: A thread finishes when it returns from the function that was specified in thread_create. Remember to de-allocate the memory used
for the thread’s stack space and context (be careful to do this after the thread is really done
using it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you create a thread, you may find it useful to invoke a "wrapper" function (also called
a stub function) that calls the thread’s function and, thus provides a place for the thread to
return to upon termination, where the necessary cleanup can be performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful when managing your ready queue which is shared across all threads. Make sure that only one thread modifies the queue at once. And be careful about signals that might interrupt updates to the shared queue of threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that the main thread (the one that’s making calls to your library) is also a schedulable context and should not be treated differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For non-preemptive scheduling policies, when your main thread calls thread_join, you
should call your function that performs scheduling. This is how the first thread gets to
execute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minimum thread control block is required to do the house keeping of context switching.
Your TCB should minimumly include the tid, ucontext and (CPU usage or priority, depending
on scheduling algorithm), but you will probably add more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To implement priority scheduling, you should create 3 linked-lists, one for each priority. Then
schedule in a Round Robin fashion among all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that when a process terminates, often times it may not use up all of 100ms. It is
your scheduler’s responsibility to handle this situation well and ensure the process next to be
scheduled will be given a full 100ms quanta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declare all internal variables and functions (those that are not called by clients of the library)
static to prevent naming conflicts with programs that link with your thread library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assumptions</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may assume that we only do one join per thread id.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may assume that we will not call thread_yield from the main thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your library functions shouldn’t print any error messages. Errors are indicated by return values, as is typical with libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "run" is defined as the time between a thread being scheduled and the thread being
descheduled (via a call to thread_join, thread_yield, or the thread’s function
finishing). So, any time a thread is scheduled, you should start timing; when a thread
is descheduled, stop; the elapsed time defines the previous "run."

<li>
<p>Change SJF to use aging to estimate execution time, rather than the average of the last three
runtimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change SJF from non-preemptive to preemptive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement priority scheduling to be more UNIX like such that a process gets penalized when
it does not finish in n quanta (up to you to define what n is). That is, its priority increases
and it will be scheduled less often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farther down the road of UNIX, implement priority scheduling such that each priority gets a
different quanta, meaning process with larger priority number is scheduled less often but its
quanta is also longer.</p>
