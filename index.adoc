== Course Info

**Welcome to CS355: Operating Systems**! 

image::octopus-os.jpg[]

A practical introduction to modern operating systems, using case studies from UNIX,
MSDOS and the Macintosh. Topics include computer and OS structures, process and
thread management, process synchronization and communication, resource allocations,
memory management, file systems, and select examples in protection and security. This
is a challenging, implementation-oriented course with a strong lab component

**Students should expect to spend at 15-20 hours of work each week, including 4.5 hours or class and lab time** 

Learning Goals:

* Processes and threads, Unix system calls
* Synchronization, classic IPC problems such as race conditions and deadlocks,
* Processor scheduling
* Memory management internals
* File system internals
* I/O and disks
* Other OS topic such as multi-processor, visualization and the cloud, OS security, etc
* Kernel design and implementation
* Performance profiling and debugging
* Experience in low-level systems programming in a realistic development environment
* programming assignments enable students to further develop the analytical skills required to manage system complexity, creative problem solving, and engages student in collaborative and in-depth application of their high-level operating system knowledge.

Learning Outcomes

* Understanding fundamental OS components and structure.
* Understanding OS design challenges and algorithms
* Knowledge of the services provided by the OS and details of major OS concepts.
* Experience in developing low-level operating system code.
* Understanding the performance and design trade-offs in complex software systems
* Experience in developing benchmarks and test suites to evaluate the performance and robustness of system
