== Covid Policy

Lectures and labs will have a _mask-friendly_ policy.  All are welcome to wear a
mask if they so wish, but no one is mandated to wear a mask. 

If you are symptomatic (coughing, sore throat, or running nose), please either
stay at home or come into campus with a mask. Lectures will be recorded so they
can be watched later. Missed lab activities and quizzes will have their grade
credit transferred to the final.
