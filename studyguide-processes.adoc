. What is a process? 
. What is the difference between a process and a C program?
. What are the different states that a process might be in?
. Why might a processed be in a blocked state?
. Why do we need special mechanisms, such as pipes or sockets, to communicate between processes?
. How can you kill a process using `ps` ?
. What is a zombie process?
. What is an orphan process?
. What is a signal? what is a signal handler?
. Some signals cannot be ignored. Name a signal that cannot be ignored and explain why a program cannot ignore it. 
. Why might we want to register a signal handler?
. When a signal arrives to a process, list three ways the process can respond to the signal.
. What happens when multiple signals arrive to a process before a process is able to process them?
. When does the OS send the SIGSEGV signal?
. When does the OS send the SIGINT signal?
. When does the OS send the SIGCHD signal?
. What signal is sent when the user types Ctrl-Z at the terminal? 
. What happens when a process calls fork?
. What happens when a signal arrives for a process?
. What type of event does SIGINT represent? Sketch a program that registers a signal handler for SIGINT?
