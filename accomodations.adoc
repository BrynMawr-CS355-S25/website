== Academic Accommodations

Classes will be recorded and close-captioned. Links to lectures will be
posted on the class slack. 

To receive an accommodation for a course activity (such as more time on quizzes
and exams), you must have an Accommodation Letter from the Office of Student
Disability Services *and* you need to contact us to work out the details of
your accommodation at least *two weeks prior* to the activity. Forms can be 
emailed to me, the instructor.

You are also welcome to contact us privately to discuss your academic needs.
However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance,
through Student Disability Services.  Also note that accommodations are not
retroactive and require advance notice to implement. More information can be
obtained at the Access Services website.
