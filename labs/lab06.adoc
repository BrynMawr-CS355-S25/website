Lab exercises for April 3rd 

The goals for this assignment are:

* Work with inodes and disks

We will use the same repository as this week's assignment: 
link:https://classroom.github.com/a/HQbSg2u5[Defragmentor Repo]. 

:sectnums:

= Print disk

In the file, `printdisk.c`, implement a program that reads a disk and prints its underlying data structure 
in terms of the superblock and its inodes.

Information about how to parse disks are in the writeup for link:../assts/asst07.html[Assignment 07].
