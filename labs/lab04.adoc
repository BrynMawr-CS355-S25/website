= Matrix Add  **Due Feb 20**

In the files, `matrix.c`, implement a program that uses M threads to add 
two matrices, each stored in its own binary file, and saving the result into a third file.

Requirements/Hints:

* Time how long it takes to compute the result when you have 8, 4, or a single thread.
* Leverage spatial locality to ensure the best performance, e.g. split the work by rows in each matrix.
* Use the program `readmat.c` to test that your program runs correctly
* Name the output file based on the two inputs, e.g. <Mat1>+<Mat2>
* Use gettimeofday(), defined in `sys/time.h` to get the duration of your program.

[source]
----
struct timeval ts, te;
gettimeofday(&ts, NULL);
...
gettimeofday(&te, NULL);
double time = te.tv_sec - ts.tv_sec + (te.tv_usec - ts.tv_usec)/1.e6;
printf("duration: %.4f\n", time);
----

The matrices you need to add are stored in a binary file that stores a sequence of integers. 

* The first integer is the number of rows
* The second integer is the number of columns
* The remaining integers are the values of the matrix, stored in row-major order. 

To test with large matrices, download them from the website (but don't check them in!)

= Funny functions **Due Feb 23**

Implement the following programs based on ucontext. 

== Return

In the file, `hello_context.c`, modify the program so it returns to main after executing f().
Use the code from lecture to help you!

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ ./hello_context
Hello World
End of main
----

== Alternate

In the file, `alternate.c`, write a program that alternates between two
functions indefinitely.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./alternate**
odd:1
even:0
odd:3
even:2
odd:5
^C
----

Send a signal to the `alternate` process. In your C file, answer the following questions:

* What happens when a signal is delivered? 
* How do signals affect the execution of a context?

Hints:

* Alternate between main and another function. 
* Make your two ucontext variables global so that main can swap to the function, and then the function can swap back to main
* The example above uses `nanosleep` to pause inside the loop
* The example above sets printf to flush immediately (e.g. show output text immediately) to make the output cleaner. This is done with the command `setvbuf(stdout, 0, _IOLBF, 0);`.

Above, main loops over odd numbers and the function loops over even numbers (see below). Each iteration, they `swapcontext`.

----
void nextEven()
{
  struct timespec delay = { 1, 0 };
  for (unsigned int i = 0;; i += 2) {
    printf("even:%d\n", i);
    nanosleep(&delay, 0);
  }
}
----


== Alarm

Can you write a program that alternates between two functions at a set interval?

In the file, `alarm.c`, write a program that alternates between two functions at a set interval. 
Use a kernel timer like in the link:sig_alarm.c[sig_alarm] demo from class.
