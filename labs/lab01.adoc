**Lab exercises for January 30th**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Working with C strings

:sectnums:

= stdout, stderr

Write a program, `outerr.c`, that outputs the even integers between 0 and 10 to standard out 
and the odd integers between 1 and 10 to standard error.

= Environment

Write a program, `myenv.c`, that loops through the process's environment variables and 
prints the value for PATH. Use the code link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2085302/printing-all-environment-variables-in-c-c[here] as a starting point. 

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./myenv** 
PATH=/home/alinen/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
$ **env | grep PATH**
PATH=/home/alinen/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
----

NOTE: The shell command `env` prints the environment 
NOTE: The paths above were truncated for brevity. Yours will be much longer!

= Advanced C strings

In assignment 02, you need to dynamically allocate a list of command line arguments. 
For example, if the command line is `ls -l`, you need to create a null-terminated 
list of strings, `[ls, -l, NULL]`. 

In the file, `argv.c`, implement a program that tokenizes a string into 
a null-terminated array of strings created dynamically with malloc. 
Then implement a function to print the array of strings using pointer arithmetic. 
Below is starter code.

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// list is a null-terminated array of strings, e.g. ["ls", "-l", NULL]
void print(char** list)
{
}

int main()
{
    char line[1024];
    strcpy(line, "ls -l -a");    

    // your code here
}
----


Requirements/Hints:

* Use `strtok` to tokenize a string.
* Use malloc and free to create the list you pass to print.
* Do not store the length of the list of strings.   
* Use valgrind to make sure you do not have memory leaks.
* Do not use standard template library data structures.

= Stack diagram

Draw a stack diagram for the program `argv.c`.

= Submission

1. Hand-in the stack diagram for your team.

2. One team member (or both) should submit their code. 

== Submit your work to Github

Add and check in your program using git and then push your changes to Github. 
Run the following command inside your `{ASST}` directory.

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {ASST}
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Descriptive message"
$ git push
----

Run `git status` to check the result of the previous git command.
Check the Github website to make sure that your program uploaded correctly.
