**Lab exercises for January 30th**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Working with processes

:sectnums:

= Zombie

A zombie process is a process that is waiting for its parent to accept its
status code, e.g. the child process exited before its parent. Zombie 
processes are "reaped" using the wait call. In the 
file, `zombie.c`, implement a program that creates a zombie process. Use the 
command `ps w` to verify that the child is a zombie and shows with status `Z`. 

= Orphan

An orphan process is a process whose parent dies before the child. In the file, 
`orphan.c`, implement a program that creates an orphan process. 
Use the command `ps w` to verify that the child is adopted by the main shell 
process. 

= Fork
