**Lab exercises for Feb 6th. Due 5pm Feb 7**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Working with processes, pipes, file descriptors

We will use the same repository as last week: link:https://classroom.github.com/a/K4qA5FE_[Labs Repo].

= Dupee Dup2

In the file, `filesort.c`, implement a program that runs the command `sort < list.txt` 
using the system calls: open, close, fork, execlp, and dup2.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **cat list.txt**
banana
apple
orange
kiwi
$ **./filesort**
apple
banana
kiwi
orange
Sort complete
----

In the above example, `filesort` performs the following steps:

* Creates a child process with fork
* The child process does the following:
** Opens the file "list.txt" 
** Maps the file descripor for "list.txt" to stdard input
** Calls execlp with arguments that correspond to sort, e.g execlp("sort", "sort", (char*) NULL)
* The parent process does the following:
** Waits for the child to complete

NOTE: Don't forget to implement error handling. Check the return code of system calls and use perror to report errors if they occur. 

= Pipe Warm-up

Use the command `man pipe` to read the man page about the pipe system call. In 
the file, `pipe.c`, copy the example from the man page. This example implements 
the followig demo.

```
The following program creates a pipe, and then fork(2)s to create a child
process; the child inherits a  duplicate  set of file descriptors that
refer to the same pipe.  After the fork(2), each process closes the file
descriptors that it doesn't need for the pipe (see pipe(7)).  The parent then
writes the string contained in the program's command-line argument to the
pipe, and the child reads this string a byte at a time from the pipe and echoes
it on standard output.  
```

Modify the example to print the parent and child PIDs like so:

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./pipe "mario takes the pipe to land 5"**
parent (3168) will send input to child: "mario takes the pipe to land 5"
child (3169) will print output from parent
mario takes the pipe to land 5
----

In the header comment of `pipe.c`, answer the following questions:

* What do the descriptors pipefd[0] and pipefd[1] refer to?
* When you run valgrind on this example, the report is printed twice. Why?
* The example is careful to close the ends of the pipe. What happens when you do not call `close()`? 

= Pipe 

In the file, `catsort.c`, implement a program that runs the command `cat list.txt | sort`
using the system calls: pipe, fork, execlp, and dup2.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **cat list.txt**
banana
apple
orange
kiwi
$ **./catsort**
apple
banana
kiwi
orange
Cat complete
Sort complete
----

In the above example, `catsort` performs the following steps:

* Creates a pipe 
* Creates two child processes with fork
* Each child process does the following:
** Uses dup2 to map one side of the pipe with either standard input or output. 
** Closes the ends of the pipe
** Calls execlp with arguments that correspond to the command
* The parent process does the following:
** Closes the ends of its pipe
** Waits for both children to complete

NOTE: Don't forget to implement error handling by checking the return code and printing the error with perror is the status of the system call is < 0.
