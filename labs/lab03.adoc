**Lab exercises for February 13th**

The goal for this assignment are:

* Working with system tools: `top H`
* Understanding process state: sleeping, running, stopped, terminated
* Working with additional system calls: sigprocmask, tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp, setpgid

We will use the same repository as last week: link:https://classroom.github.com/a/K4qA5FE_[Labs Repo]. 
Click on the link and then accept and merge the pull request.

= Infinite

Write a program, `infinite.c`, that calls `pause()` in an infinite loop. When you 
run `ps w`, the status of infinite should be S.

$ **./infinite &**

$ **ps w**

   10 pts/0    Ss     0:00 -bash

  347 pts/3    Ss+    0:00 -bash
  743 pts/1    Ss+    0:00 -bash
 2320 pts/0    S      0:00 ./infinite
 2321 pts/0    R+     0:00 ps w
----

Use your program to see how job control works in `bash`. Use the tools, `top H`
and `ps w` to see how suspending (job status: T), foregrounding (job status:
S+), and backgrounding (job status: S) change the state of the process.

= Child Monitor

Write a program, `monitor.c`, that forks a process whose state can be controlled by 
the user separately from its parent (e.g. the child has its own process group). 
Using a signal handler on SIGCHLD, report the status changes of the child process.

alinen@sutekh:~/cs355/os-devel/labs/03$ ./monitor
Monitoring child process 6242.
quit

6242 received signal Terminated
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Make sure the child has a different process ID from the parent. 
* Create a child that loops forever so it is convenient to change its process status.
* From another terminal, use the command: `kill -STOP <pid>` to stop the process. 
* From another terminal, use the command: `kill -CONT <pid>` to continue the process. 
* From another terminal, use the command: `kill -TERM <pid>` to terminate the process. 
* Try sending other signals, such as `kill -ALRM <pid>`, and see what happens to the process. Some signals, such as SIGTTOU will cause the process to stop; others will cause the process to quit.
* Typing `quit` should quit the parent process and kill the child
* Inside your signal handler, use a non-blocking `waitpid` call, configured to also return if the child process stops or continues (see the man page for details). 

Use strace to better understand the signaling behavior, e.g. 

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **strace -e 'trace=!all' -f ./monitor**
strace: Process 6254 attached
Monitoring child process 6254.
[pid  6254] --- SIGSTOP {si_signo=SIGSTOP, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=743, si_uid=1000} ---
[pid  6254] --- stopped by SIGSTOP ---
[pid  6253] --- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_STOPPED, si_pid=6254, si_uid=1000, si_status=SIGSTOP, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---

6254 stopped.
----

Inside a header comment, answer the following questions:

. What happens if the parent and child both belong to the same process group?
. What happens when SIGCONT is sent to a process that is already running?
. What happens when SIGSTP is sent to a process already stopped?
. What happens when you send the signal SIGTTOU?
. What happens when you send he signal SIGALRM?

= Foreground/Background

Implement a program, `fgbg.c`, that forks a process in the background and then allows the 
user to switch it between the foreground and background using the commands, fg, bg, and control-Z. 

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **./fgbg**
[1] Created process 6982 in the background
$ **fg**
^Zchild stopped.
$ **bg**
child continued.
$ **fg**
^Zchild stopped.
$ **quit**
child received signal Terminated
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Make sure the child has a different process ID from the parent. 
* Create a child that loops forever so it is convenient to change its process status.
* Typing Control-Z should suspend the foreground process. 
* Typing Control-C should exit the foreground process. If the foreground process is the parent, the child should also be exited.
* Typing bg should move the child into the background
* Typing fg should move the child into the foreground
* Typing `quit` should quit the parent process and exit the child
* Inside a signal handler, use a non-blocking `waitpid` call, configured to also return if the child process stops or continues (see the man page for details). 
* Whenever the child is stopped, make sure to return the terminal to the parent.
* Configure the parent to ignore SIGTTOU and SIGTTIN signals so it can modify ownership of the terminal, even when it is running in the background.
* Use `top H` to monitor the terminal and process status of both the parent and child
