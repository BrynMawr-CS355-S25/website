. Suppose we are using a 10K blocksize. Give the linked list that represents the free blocks in memory.  Assume each node in the linked list contains the process ID, or H if it a hole, a start location, a size, and a pointer to the next record.

. What is the translation lookaside buffer? What is its purpose?
. Suppose we have 32-bit addresses, 4 KB page sizes, and the a two-level page table. The first 10 bits are an index into the first page table. The next 10 bits are an index into the second page table. Compute the indices into the page tables and offset for the following addresses:
