. List 4 goals of file system design.
. Consider the following set of files: A has 2 blocks. B has 5 blocks. C has 1 block. Assume they are stored on a system with 4 KB block sizes. Draw how we would store the files 
.. using contiguous allocation
.. using linked lists having nodes stored with each block
.. using a file allocation table (FAT)
.. using inodes
