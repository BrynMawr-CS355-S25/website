$ mkdir B
$ cd B
$ mkdir A

.. If we were using inodes, how many inodes would we need to represent the above file system?
.. Suppose directories store the contents of the directory. Each entry of the table contains the following information: inode id, name (8 bytes), extension (3 bytes), and flags (4 bytes). The least significant bit of flags is 0 for files and 1 for directories. The most significant bit is 1 for a non-empty entry and 0 for an empty entry.
