1. A zombie process is a process that is waiting for its parent to accept its
status code, e.g. the child process exited before its parent. Zombie
processes are "reaped" using the wait call. Sketch a program that creates a 
zombie process. You can test your program by implementing it and using `ps w` 
to verify that the child has zombie status.

2. An orphan process is a process whose parent dies before the child. Sketch a 
program that creates an orphan process. You can test your program by implementing 
it and using `ps w` to verify that the child is adopted by the main shell
process.
